Untold Aeons
============

## Stats 

### Primary (all 1-5)

 - Dexterity    -> dodge in combat, disengaging, diving for cover, ...
 - Toughness    -> HP total, grappling, damage reduction?
 - Willpower    -> Stress limit, Sanity saves / resistance
 - Intellect    -> more starting skills, idea rolls, 

Character Creation: Distribute 12 points between the 4 characteristics.

### Secondary

Stress Limit: 10 + Willpower

Health: 10 + Toughness  (Maybe 2 x Toughness?)

Move Speed: 5 + Dexterity  (yards / round (about 5 seconds))
    - This is the base "walking" speed while the character is also busy fighting / shooting etc
    - In a full-on sprint characters can go up to 5 times their Move Speed per round
    - A sustained run is about 2-3 times their speed per round

## Karma points (i.e. story / fate points)

  There are two pools, the narrator and player pool. 
  The narrator starts with one karma point, and the players pool starts with 1 point for each player.
  When a point is used it moves to the other pool. E.g. a players uses a karma point it moves to the Narrator's pool.
  This means that using a karma point can give you benefits, but will likely come back to bite you at some point in the future.
  
  - Player Use:
    - reroll dice (sorta like pushing)
    - +2 on any roll (or maybe just +1 success?)
    - +2 difficulty to an NPC's roll
    - deus ex machina: "good thing I brought that shovel!" (used at the Narrator's discretion)
 

  - Narrator use:
    - trigger a hallucination/phobia/mania/... (but don't say it, just pass a note)
    - +2 on an NPC's roll (or maybe just +1 success?)
    - +2 difficulty to a player's roll



## Skills

### Skill Check

Opposed skill checks / perception checks:
   - Idea: let players roll their skill, without the difficutly dice, and the narrator rolls the difficulty dice behind the screen. This way the players have some idea of how well they did but are never quite sure.


FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU NEED TO ROLL 0!  
Idea: Roll a d6 / UA Dice, but you only get a single success on a 6, nothing on 1-5, not even advantage on 1.

#### Skill Bonus
Skill bonus = floor(skill / 2)
This is the number that is added to the other person's skill when assisting. Maybe? Or just 1


### Standard Skills

Standard skills all start at 1, professional skills must be learned (either in character creation or during play)

- Basic:
  - athletics
  - Driving
  - First Aid
  - Investigation
  - Knowledge
    - Represents "basic" knowledge / education level
    - Can be used instead of any specific knowledge skill but with 2 penalty dice
  - Perception
  - Stealth
  - Streetwise
  - Survival
- Social:
  - Charm
  - Deception
  - Insight
  - Intimidation
  - Persuasion
  - English
- Combat:
  - Brawl
  - Handgun
  - Rifle / Shotgun

  
### Character Creation & Improvement
  The character's background has a set of starting skill levels,
  and on top of that players get ___ starting xp to freely spend.
  
  Players get additional xp based on the Intelligence stat.

  - Improving a skill: 10 * current rank xp
    - this means that getting a skill from 1 to 5 takes 100 xp
  - Improving characteristic? (maybe 50 * current rank xp?)
  - Learn a new professional skill: 20 xp 
    - starts at 1
    - Needs a source (teacher, books, ...)

    
## Stress & Sanity

(Or... What about no sanity at all, but instead just have permanent side effects (manias, phobias, ...) when stress goes above the limit. It would provide the same roleplay elements without adding another stat to keep track of. Even the "recovering in a mental ward" could be kept as a way to get rid of those traumas.)

- Seeing something -> Sanity check (Willpower) (difficuly based on severity of the cause)
  - Success -> Gain Stress equal to the difficulty
  - Failure -> Gain Stress equal to the difficulty plus number of failures (*before* cancelling them out)
  - Adv / Disadv -> short term effect (1 round)
      - Advantage: adrenaline rush, fearless, bonus on next san check, ...
      - Disadvantage: scream in terror, involuntary action in combat, freeze, ...

- If your stress goes above your limit you must make an Intellect roll with 1 difficulty dice for each point you are above your limit  
  - If you succeed nothing happens, though you must roll again if you gain more stress
  - If you fail you become Shaken  

- Shaken:
  - -1 to all rolls (including sanity) until stress is reduced below limit
  - Disadvantages can be used to trigger "fun stuff"! (phobias, manias, delusions, ...)
  - The goal should be to give the players an "oh no..." feeling when they become shaken
  - While Shaken, the effects of (dis)advantages become amplified and more long-term / permanent (this includes the check that put you over the edge, not just the subsequent ones)
    - disadvantage: Phobia, catatonia, paranoid, flee in terror, 
    - advantage: hardened?

- Stress hits 2x limit make an Intellect save or Faint / Fall Unconsious (Going temporarily insane would probably be better)
  (same mechanic as above)

Recovering Stress: Once a day you make a difficulty 0 Willpower check. If your stress is below your limit you lose 1 stress for every success. If it is above your limit you lose stress equal to half the number of successes (rounded down) 


### Becoming Hardened

Whenever you pass a sanity check of a difficulty higher than your current hardened level in that category *while Shaken* you gain a "hardened notch". When you have three "notches" your hardened level increases by one. (or maybe advantages while shaken instead?)

Hardened levels act like the mental equivalent of armor, reducing the stress "damage" you take by your hardened level in that category.

Being hardened also affects and changes the personality of the character, becoming more cold and uncaring.

### Goals for sanity mechanics
  - Permanent Mental Trauma
  - Harden over time? (stress "armor")
  - Temporary Positive Effects (Adrenaline rush, ...)
  - Temporary Negative Effects (Flee, ...)
  - Stress gain from Sanity checks
  - Shaken when >= Stress Limit
  - Faint when >= 2x Stress Limit
  - Different types of sanity check?
  - Give players more agency in the outcome of sanity checks? (like Trail of Cthulhu)

  
  
## Combat

Goal for combat: Every roll should be meaningful, not just endless "roll to hit, roll for damage, repeat" 

Okay, I should *really* make the health system more analogous to the stress system!  
Something like:

- wound limit: 10 + Toughness

- if your total damage taken is more than your limit you must make a Toughness roll with 1 difficulty dice for each point you are above your limit  
  - If you succeed nothing happens, though you must roll again if you take more damage
  - If you fail you are Severly Injured

- Severely Injured:  
  - you have likely suffered a permanent injury and are currently incapacitated (be it passed out or simply unable to fight / act)
  - Additionally, you take one damage every minute (or round?) until your receive medical care

- Damage taken > 2x limit: make a Toughness save or Die  
  (same mechanic as above)  
  Additionally, make another save every X minutes until you recieve successful medical care (First Aid, Medicine, ...)
  

Additionally: feel free to ask for stress rolls when significant injuries are suffered. This is done at the discretion of the Narrator

### Natural healing
Once a day you make a difficulty 0 Toughness check. If your injuries are below your limit you heal one wound for every success. If they are above your limit you heal a number of wounds equal to half the number of successes (rounded down)

### Initiative
There are 2 possible types of turns: Fast and Slow turns.  
In a Slow turn you can take and action *and* move, in a slow turn you can either take an action *or* move.  
Everyone involved in the fight chooses if they want to take a Fast or Slow turn.

Generally, the side initiating the fight goes first
So, the turn order is as follows:  
Initiating side (*Fast*) **>** Defending side (*Fast*) **>** Initiating side (*Slow*) **>** Defending side (*Slow*)

If multiple combatants go at the same time they can choose the order in which they act.


Surprise?  
This already kinda covers surprise! so no specific suprise mechanic

### Attack Roll

When being attacked, either:
  - **Dodge**: Roll Dex to avoid, *but* fall prone afterwards
    - Ties are in favour of the defender
    - Defender takes no damage if they win
  - **Defend**: Roll Brawl to defend yourself
    - Ties are in favour of the defender
    - Defender takes no damage if they win
  - **Fight Back**: Roll Brawl to fight back  
    - Ties are in favour of the attacker
    - Defender takes no damage if they win *and* land a hit of their own
  - If both combatants get 0 successes nothing happens 


### Firearms

Ranged Attack:  
Base difficulty: 
  - Point blank: 1
  - less than weapon range: 2
  - less than 2x weapon range: 3
  - etc.

+1 difficulty when firing at moving target, partial cover, ...
-1 difficulty when firing at ...

The combatant who's being shot at has the option to try diving away (only if they're aware they're being shot at). If they choose to do so the difficulty of the shot is increased by half the target's Dexterity (rounding *up*), however, the person diving for cover will be prone until they get up again (which takes an action).

what about auto fire?  

Weapon Trait: **Auto Fire  \<N\>**
When you use this weapon you may choose to rapidly fire many shots instead of just one. If you do this you take 1 penalty dice to your Firearms skill. Then, if your attack succeeds, you manage to hit a number of shots up to your MoS (Margin of Success), but never more than **N**. Each shot deals damage as usual (base damage + #S)
If you roll advantages you can make a single hit into a critical hit for each advantage you rolled.



### Resolving (Dis)Advantages

(See Genesys p.104 for ideas)

Advantage:
  - 1:
    - +1 on next allied skill check
    - notice something useful
    - -1 to target enemy next skill check
  - 2:
    - extra maneuver
    - bypass cover/armor/...
  - 3:
    - ?

Disadvantage:
  - 1:
    - Suffer 1 stress
  - 2:
    - opponent gets free maneuver
    - +1 to all opponents when targeting this player until next turn
  - 3:
    - ?
  


### Damage Calculation

Damage Dealt = Weapon Base Damage + Successes Rolled (*before* cancelling out)

Damage Taken = Damage Dealt - max(0, Toughness - Piercing) 

If an attack succeeds *with Advantage* it's a critical hit, dealing double base damage (before reducing it by the Toughness)
(Idea: what about double non-base damage? makes more sense sort of, but need to check the maths)

Melee weapons will often deal extra damage based on your Toughness, this is denoted by adding a "+" to the damage number, so a weapons dealing "1+" damage will have a base damage of 1 + your Toughness.

Unarmed attacks have a base damage of "0+", i.e. your Toughness without any bonuses

## Open Questions

  - Pusing rolls?
    - Okay, Idea:
      What if players can push a roll by spending a Karma point. Makes those more interesting and narratively makes sense too!
  - Stress from (dis)adv or not?
  - What a bout a RQ-esque Passions mechanic?
